Personal book catalog for keeping track of book collections. Created by me for my beautiful wife. 

Once I am happy with the feature set for books I will be expanding the functionality to include other forms of physical media: CDs, DvDs, Video Games, Board Games, Records, Tapes, etc. 

# Features

* Automatic book creation and cover art download from ISBN
* Manual Book Creation
* Manual Cover Art Upload
* Table Sorting by Clicking Headers
